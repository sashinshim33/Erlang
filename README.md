# Overview

In this project, my goal was to deepen my understanding of concurrent programming and process-based system design. As a software engineer, learning new paradigms—especially ones that differ from traditional object-oriented approaches—is important for expanding how I solve problems. Erlang is built around lightweight processes and message passing, so building a small chat system gave me hands-on experience with how these ideas work in a real application.

This program is a simple Erlang multi-user chat application. Each user runs as its own independent process, and all communication is handled through a central server that routes broadcast and private messages. Creating this helped me understand how Erlang handles processes, pattern matching, and message passing in a practical, interactive way.
